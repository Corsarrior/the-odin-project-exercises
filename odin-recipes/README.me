This is a HTML project from The Odin Project open source curriculum for learning web development that consist of main index page with links to a few recipes and gif as decorative element.

In this static web page I use a HTML boilerplate, a unordered list, internal and external links, the use of absolute an relative paths, headings and paragraphs 
elements.
